# Programming-Paradigm

## Description
Many organizations store user data in CSV files. This program allows them to quickly extract relevant information from these files to perform a basic analysis, such as counting users and analyzing email domains (this could improve depending on the data the orgnization want).

It is useful for:
- Extraction of data from CSV files.
- Data processing by counting the number of users and the distribution of email domains.
- Generated reports
- Automation of data extraction and analysis

## Models
This is the model we used for the programming paradigm.

- Read CSV File: The program starts by reading the content of a CSV file containing user information and parsing it by using "read_and_extract_data()".
- Process Data: The program counts the number of users and emails domains by using "process_data()".
- Generate Report: The program generates a report summarizing the information by using "generate_report()".
